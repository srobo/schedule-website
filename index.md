## Arrival

On arrival, you should make your way to reception, who will then point you to the volunteer sign in point.

You **do** need to fill out a media consent form, and you will need a wristband.

If you said you had a Student Robotics t-shirt, please arrive wearing that, or have it ready to change into.

## Changing roles

Please stick to the schedule provided, as the competition depends on having enough people in the right place at
the right time.

You may find yourself doing a role you've never done before, or lost somewhere in the venue, this is fine!

If you:
* are lost
* don't know what you're meant to be doing
* would like something to do
* have any other issues

Please find Jimmy, who will be walking around the competition venue.
